# File Locking System
This project is focused on making your own secured system for text files. We will work with txt files.

## How does it works ? 

If file will be secured by our code, it will contain 3 parts. 

#### 1. PART
First row consist of some text which will symbolize locked file, for example #password. Thankfully this word we will know if the file is secured or not. It could be everything else, it is up to you what you choose.

#### 2. PART
Second row will consist of password we will need to enter to unlock file.

#### 3. PART
Entire text.

## SAMPLE
#password

Instagram is a photo and video-sharing social networking service owned by Facebook, Inc. It was created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, and launched in October 2010 exclusively on iOS. A version for Android devices was released a year and half later, in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited website interface in November 2012, and apps for Windows 10 Mobile and Windows 10 in April 2016 and October 2016 respectively.

#### As you can see here, in the 1st row is text determining locked file, 2nd row consists of password you have to enter and rest is hidden text
